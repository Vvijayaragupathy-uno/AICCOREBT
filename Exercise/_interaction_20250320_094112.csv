"A university employee reports their smartphone containing university email was stolen while traveling. According to principles in policies like WPI's, what is the correct sequence of actions?",2025-03-20 09:41:12,"A timely question!

According to principles in policies like WPI's (Worcester Polytechnic Institute), the correct sequence of actions when a university employee reports their smartphone containing university email was stolen while traveling is:

1. **Immediate Reporting**: The employee must immediately report the incident to the university's IT department or designated incident response team. This helps prevent potential data breaches and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access to university email and data.
2. **Remote Wipe (if possible)**: If the device is configured to allow remote wipe, the IT department may attempt to remotely wipe the device to remove all data, including university email and any other sensitive information.
3. **Change Passwords**: The employee must change their university email password and any other passwords that may have been stored on the device. This helps prevent unauthorized access to university systems and data.
4. **Notify Supervisors and Colleagues**: The employee should notify their supervisors and colleagues about the incident, so they are aware of the situation and can take necessary precautions.
5. **Conduct a Risk Assessment**: The IT department or incident response team will conduct a risk assessment to determine the potential impact of the stolen device on university data and systems.
6. **Take Additional Measures (if necessary)**: Depending on the risk assessment, additional measures may be taken, such as monitoring university systems for suspicious activity, notifying affected parties, or taking steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
7. **Document the Incident**: The incident should be thoroughly documented, including the actions taken to respond to the incident, to help improve incident response processes and prevent similar incidents in the future.

By following this sequence of actions, the university can minimize the risk of data breaches and protect sensitive information.","<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of actions for a university employee whose smartphone with university email was stolen while traveling. I remember that universities have specific policies, like WPI's, so I need to think about what steps are typically outlined there.

First, the employee should realize the phone is stolen. The immediate reaction would be to contact local authorities. I think that's the first step because reporting a theft to the police is essential for any official procedure, including insurance claims or university records. So, I'll note that as step one.

After reporting to the police, the employee needs to inform their supervisor or department head. This makes sense because the higher-ups need to know so they can assess the situation and provide any necessary support or initiate an investigation. So, that's step two.

Next, the employee should contact the university's IT department. They would be responsible for securing any sensitive information that might have been on the phone. Steps could include remotely wiping the device or locking the email account to prevent unauthorized access. So, step three is contacting IT.

Then, the employee should check with their own insurance. If they have personal insurance that covers theft or loss of devices, they might need to file a claim. However, I'm not sure if this comes before or after other steps. Maybe it's better to do it after reporting to the university but before trying to retrieve the device. Alternatively, it could be part of the process after dealing with the immediate security issues. I'll place it as step four.

After dealing with insurance, the employee might want to retrieve the phone if it's found. But that's only if possible, and it should be done through the proper channels, maybe with the help of IT to ensure data security. So, step five is attempting retrieval if possible.

Finally, the employee should review and update security measures to prevent future incidents. This includes things like enabling Find My Device, using strong passwords, and being more cautious with personal devices. So, that's step six.

Wait, maybe step three and four could be swapped. Sometimes, insurance requires a police report number, so the employee needs to have that before filing a claim. So perhaps after step one (reporting to police), step two is contacting the supervisor, step three is contacting IT, and step four is handling insurance. Or maybe contacting IT comes before dealing with insurance. Hmm.

I think the immediate priority is to secure the device and data, which would be"
