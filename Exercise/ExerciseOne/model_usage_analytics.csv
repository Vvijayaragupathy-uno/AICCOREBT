According to best practices aligned with WPI's Mobile Device Management Policy, what should happen next?",1.0,300,llama-3.2-90b-vision-preview,"According to best practices aligned with a Mobile Device Management (MDM) Policy, the university IT administrator should take the following steps:

1. **Notify the faculty member**: Inform the faculty member that the custom operating system is not compliant with the university's MDM policy.
2. **Explain the risks**: Briefly explain the security risks associated with using a non-standard operating system on a university-provided device, such as potential vulnerabilities to malware and data breaches.
3. **Request removal**: Request that the faculty member uninstall the custom operating system and restore the device to its original configuration, which is typically a standard, university-supported operating system.
4. **Offer support**: Offer assistance to the faculty member in configuring the device to meet their needs while ensuring compliance with the MDM policy.
5. **Document the incident**: Document the incident, including the faculty member's response and any actions taken, in accordance with the university's incident response plan.
6. **Consider revoking access**: If the faculty member is unwilling to comply, the university IT administrator may need to consider revoking access to university resources or temporarily suspending the device's network connection to protect the university's network and data.

According to best practices aligned with WPI's Mobile Device Management Policy, what should happen next?",1.0,300,llama3-70b-8192,"According to WPI's Mobile Device Management Policy, university-owned smart devices must have the manufacturer's installed operating system (OS) and vendor updates must be accepted and installed when required (Section 4.0). 

In this scenario, the faculty member has installed a custom operating system on their university-provided smartphone, which is not in compliance with the policy. 

As a result, the IT administrator should take the following steps:

1. Notify the faculty member of the policy violation and explain the risks associated with using a custom operating system on a university-owned device.
2. Request that the faculty member restore the device to its original manufacturer-installed operating system.
3. If the faculty member is unable or unwilling to restore the device, the IT administrator may need to remotely wipe the device to ensure the security and integrity of university data.

This action is necessary to minimize the risk of a security breach and to ensure that the device is managed and configured according to the university's security policies.",164
