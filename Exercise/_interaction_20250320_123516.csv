"A university IT administrator discovers that a faculty member has installed a custom operating system on their university-provided smartphone. According to best practices aligned with WPI's Mobile Device Management Policy, what should happen next?",2025-03-20 12:35:16,"According to best practices aligned with WPI's Mobile Device Management Policy, when a university IT administrator discovers that a faculty member has installed a custom operating system on their university-provided smartphone, the following steps should occur:

1. **Notification and Awareness**: The IT administrator should notify the faculty member that the custom operating system is not compliant with the university's Mobile Device Management Policy. The faculty member should be informed about the risks associated with using a non-standard operating system, such as potential security breaches, data loss, or compromise of university data.

2. **Remediation**: The faculty member should be requested to remove the custom operating system and reinstall the standard, university-approved operating system. If the faculty member is unable or unwilling to do so, the IT administrator may need to remotely wipe the device to restore it to its original, approved configuration.

3. **Device Isolation (if necessary)**: If the custom operating system is deemed to pose a significant security risk, the IT administrator may need to isolate the device from the university network to prevent any potential security breaches.

4. **Policy Review and Acknowledgement**: The faculty member should be required to review and acknowledge the university's Mobile Device Management Policy, ensuring they understand the requirements and consequences of non-compliance.

5. **Monitoring and Follow-up**: The IT administrator should monitor the device to ensure the faculty member has complied with the remediation request and that the device is restored to its approved configuration. Regular follow-ups can help prevent similar incidents","According to WPI's Mobile Device Management Policy and best practices, the IT administrator should follow these steps:

1. Inform the faculty member about the violation of the Mobile Device Management Policy. The policy generally requires that all university-provided devices run approved operating systems for better security, support, and compatibility.

2. Explain the risks associated with using a custom operating system, such as reduced security, potential data breaches, compatibility issues, and limited support from the IT department.

3. Request the faculty member to remove the custom operating system and revert to a WPI-supported and approved operating system. Provide guidance and assistance, if necessary.

4. Schedule a follow-up meeting or communication to confirm the faculty member has complied with the policy and reinstalled a WPI-supported operating system.

5. Document the incident for potential future policy enforcement or training purposes.

6. Remind the faculty member of the importance of adhering to WPI's Mobile Device Management Policy and the potential consequences of further violations.

7. Offer training or resources to help the faculty member understand the importance of using approved operating systems and staying compliant with WPI's policies.","<think>
Okay, so I'm a university IT administrator, and I just found out that one of the faculty members has installed a custom operating system on their university-provided smartphone. I need to figure out what to do next according to best practices and our WPI Mobile Device Management Policy.

First, I should recall what the policy entails. Typically, such policies are in place to ensure security, proper functionality, and compliance with institutional standards. So, having a custom OS might violate these terms because it could expose the device to security risks, make it harder to manage, and potentially lead to data breaches.

I think the first step is to document everything. I need to record when I found out, who was involved, what the device is, and what the current issue is. This documentation will be important if any disciplinary action is needed or if there's a need to escalate the issue further.

Next, I should review the relevant policies. Our Mobile Device Management Policy probably states that university-provided devices must use the approved OS and configurations. So, having a custom OS would be a violation of that policy. I need to be clear on what the policy says so that I can address the issue appropriately.

Then, I should contact the faculty member. It's important to communicate with them about the issue. They might have a good reason for installing the custom OS, or they might not be aware of the policy. I should inform them of the violation and explain the implications, like potential security risks and"
