Okay, so the user is asking whether they can let their team store work emails on their devices for up to three months as per their Mobile Device Management policy. They want a yes or no answer. 

I need to consider what MDM policies usually allow. Typically, MDM policies are about managing mobile devices securely. Allowing email storage for a period is common for convenience and reference. So, yes, it's possible to implement such a policy.
