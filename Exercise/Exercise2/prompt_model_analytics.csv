Step 1: Understand the Central Concern
The primary concern here is: Can employees effectively store work emails on their devices for up to three months according to the Mobile device management policy?

Step 2: Evaluate Storage Capacity
Secondly, we need to know if their devices have sufficient storage space to hold emails spanning over three months.

Step 3: Consider Email Size
The emails themselves should also be considered in terms of storage size - are they typically small attachments or large files, which may impact the available storage space?

Step 4: Explore Email App Functionality
Now, we need to consider the email app's functionality. Does it efficiently manage storage by removing emails older than the specified time or requires manual deletion of emails older than the chosen time frame?

Step 5: Assess Disposal Policy
Upon reviewing the size, storage capacity, and app functionality, it's essential to understand if there is a designated process for disposing of emails that are older than the chosen time frame - three months in this case.

**Step 1: Understand the problem**
The problem states that you want to use a Nokia 2017 as a personal device and connect it to university devices.

**Step 2: Identify the key concern**
The key concern is whether using this device would violate the university's mobile-device policy.

**Step 3: Analyze the device**
The device in question is a Nokia 2017, which is a personal device and not a university-issued device.

**Step 4: Consider the university's mobile-device policy**
The policy is not explicitly stated, but we can make an educated assumption. Typically, university mobile-device policies govern the use of personal devices on university networks and systems to ensure security and data protection.

**Step 5: Evaluate the connection to university devices**
You want to connect your personal Nokia 2017 device to university devices, which implies accessing university networks, systems, or resources.

**Step 6: Determine policy violation**
Given the typical nature of university mobile-device policies, it is likely that connecting a personal device to university devices would be subject to certain security and access controls. Without knowing the specific policy, we cannot assume that the device meets these controls.

**Step 1: Identify the symptoms**
The device is exhibiting three specific symptoms:
	* Increased battery usage
	* Initiating connections to various IP addresses
	* Unfamiliar apps appear to be installed

**Step 2: Analyze each symptom**
	* Increased battery usage: This could be indicative of a malicious process or malware running in the background, consuming system resources.
	* Initiating connections to various IP addresses: This is a common behavior of malware or Trojans, which often ""call home"" to receive instructions or send stolen data.
	* Unfamiliar apps appear to be installed: This suggests that the device may have been compromised, allowing an attacker to install malicious software.

**Step 3: Evaluate the cumulative evidence**
The combination of these three symptoms strongly suggests that the device is not functioning normally.

**Step 4: Determine if the evidence is conclusive**

**Step 1: Identify the symptoms**
The device is exhibiting three specific symptoms:
	* Increased battery usage
	* Initiating connections to various IP addresses
	* Unfamiliar apps appear to be installed

**Step 2: Analyze each symptom**
	* Increased battery usage: This could be indicative of a malicious process or malware running in the background, consuming system resources.
	* Initiating connections to various IP addresses: This is a common behavior of malware or Trojans, which often ""call home"" to receive instructions or send stolen data.
	* Unfamiliar apps appear to be installed: This suggests that the device may have been compromised, allowing an attacker to install malicious software.

**Step 3: Evaluate the cumulative evidence**
The combination of these three symptoms strongly suggests that the device is not functioning normally.

**Step 4: Determine if the evidence is conclusive**
Given the consistency of the symptoms with common indicators of a compromised device, it is reasonable to conclude that the device is likely compromised.

**Conclusion**
