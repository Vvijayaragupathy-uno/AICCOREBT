"A university IT administrator discovers that a faculty member has installed a custom operating system on their university-provided smartphone. According to best practices aligned with WPI's Mobile Device Management Policy, what should happen next?",2025-03-21 08:54:21,"According to WPI's Mobile Device Management Policy, university-owned smart devices must have the manufacturer's installed operating system (OS) and vendor updates must be accepted and installed when required (Section 4.0). 

In this scenario, the faculty member has installed a custom operating system on their university-provided smartphone, which is not in compliance with the policy. 

As a result, the IT administrator should take the following steps:

1. Notify the faculty member of the policy violation and explain the risks associated with using a custom operating system on a university-owned device.
2. Request that the faculty member restore the device to its original manufacturer-installed operating system.
3. If the faculty member is unable or unwilling to restore the device, the IT administrator may need to remotely wipe the device to ensure the security and integrity of university data.

This action is necessary to minimize the risk of a security breach and to ensure that the device is managed and configured according to the university's security policies."
