1. **Notification and Education**: The IT administrator should notify the faculty member of the policy violation and educate them on the risks associated with installing custom operating systems on university-provided devices. This includes explaining the potential security threats, data breaches, and compliance issues that can arise from unauthorized modifications.

2. **Device Isolation**: The IT administrator should isolate the device from the university's network to prevent any potential security risks from spreading. This may involve revoking the device's access to university resources, such as email, Wi-Fi, or VPN.

3. **Assessment and Analysis**: The IT administrator should assess the device to determine the extent of the custom operating system installation and identify any potential security vulnerabilities or data breaches.

4. **Remediation**: The faculty member should be required to restore the device to its original, university-approved operating system. If necessary, the IT administrator may need to remotely wipe the device or perform a factory reset to ensure the removal of the custom operating system.

5. **Policy Acknowledgement**: The faculty member should be required to acknowledge and agree to comply with WPI's Mobile Device Management Policy, including any consequences for future non-compliance.

6. **Incident Reporting**: The IT administrator should document the incident and report it to the appropriate university"
