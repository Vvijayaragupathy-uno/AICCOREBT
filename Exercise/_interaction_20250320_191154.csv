1. **Notification and Education**: The IT administrator should notify the faculty member about the non-compliance with the university's Mobile Device Management Policy. The IT administrator should educate the faculty member about the risks associated with installing custom operating systems on university-provided devices, including potential security breaches, data loss, and compatibility issues.
2. **Remediation**: The faculty member should be required to restore the device to its original, university-approved operating system to ensure compliance with the Mobile Device Management Policy. This may involve wiping the device and re-installing the approved operating system.
3. **Security Assessment**: The IT administrator should perform a security assessment to ensure that the device is free from any malware or other security risks that may have been introduced by the custom operating system.
4. **Re-enrollment in MDM**: Once the device is restored to its original operating system, the faculty member should re-enroll the device in the university's Mobile Device Management (MDM) system to ensure that the device is properly managed and secured.
5. **Documentation and Follow-up**: The IT administrator should document the incident, including the notification, remediation, and security assessment. The IT administrator should also follow up with the faculty member to ensure that the device remains compliant with the university's Mobile Device Management Policy.
