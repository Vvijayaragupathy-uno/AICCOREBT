Step 1: Identify the relevant information provided:
- The device in question is a Nokia 2017.
- The device is intended for personal use.
- The device needs to be connected to university devices.
- There is a mobile-device policy in place.

Step 2: Consider the key aspects of the mobile-device policy that might be relevant to this situation:
- The policy might have restrictions on the types of devices allowed for connection to university devices.
- The policy might have requirements for device security, such as software updates or encryption.
- The policy might have rules about personal devices being used for university-related activities.

Step 3: Analyze the Nokia 2017 device in relation to the potential policy restrictions:
- The Nokia 2017 is a personal device, which might be allowed for connection to university devices depending on the policy.
- The Nokia 2017 is a relatively old device (released in 2017), which might not meet the policy's security requirements (e.g., outdated operating system, lack of recent security updates).

Step 4: Weigh the available information and make an educated inference:
- Since the policy's specifics are unknown, it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion.
- However, considering the device's age and potential security limitations, it is possible that the Nokia 2017 might not comply with the university's mobile-device policy.

Conclusion:
 Based on the available information,"
